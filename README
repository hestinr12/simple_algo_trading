Welcome to a simple trading set up built using IbPy

Obvious Disclaimer: Work in progress...



IbPy is a dependency of this project, and is NOT available on pip. To install, please for the repo and run setup.py to make this usable.

Actual implementations of some files are hidden for intellectual property reasons and will not be released in the future. I will, however, be adding "dummy" versions of these to avoid breaking it entirely ^_^
